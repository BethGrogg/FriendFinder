# FriendFinder

This application is designed to match the user up with their most compatible friend based on their responses to 10 questions.  The user first fills out the survey and then a modal pops up with their most compatible friend's name and photo.

This application utilizes html, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, express, and node.
